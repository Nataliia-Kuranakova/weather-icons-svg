# Weather icons SVG

## Introduction


This set of icons is primarily intended for integration with the [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/), with each icon name corresponding directly to the value of the "icon" field used in that API. This systematic naming ensures easy integration into projects that use Visual Crossing weather data. But they can be easily adapted with any other APIs for different purposes.

Before deciding to use them in your projects, you can preview the entire stack of icons in the `icons-set.svg` file.
